# Portfolio Sanket Kambli

## Description

sanket.dev is a dynamic Personal Portfolio System (PPS), designed to serve as an interactive showcase of my technical skills and professional journey. This comprehensive project introduces a carefully designed approach to modern front-end development, using foundational techniques and tools, leveraging the power of pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It efficiently organizes my project history, technical abilities, and professional background, providing a seamless platform for recruiters, collaborators, and industry peers.

This system offers an engaging user experience through on-scroll animations and a fluid, full-page navigation system, ensuring content is accessible and memorable.
